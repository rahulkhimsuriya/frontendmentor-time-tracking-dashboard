## My process

1. get the design and start with just basic markup. don't think about how this element go there and there bla bla bla.
2. add (from Framework) or create css and think about which element goes where.
3. refactor with reusable componant **(i'm working with Framework)**

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) - Chakra UI framework

### What I learned

- I enjoyed working with [`Chakra UI`](https://chakra-ui.com/).
- it's so easy, if you know [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/) or familiar with any utility first css framework.
- my first choise was [`Evergreen`](https://evergreen.segment.com/), but there is no responsive support for that, for responsive you've to create classes and write media query, so i changed my mind.

### Useful resources
